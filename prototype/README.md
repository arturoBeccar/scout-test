# Simple Flash loan Lender prototype

Seems secure and implements the correct logic.

TODO: write and wrap all the traits and implement them in the contract:
- Borrow trait: borrow the money and check that the lender returned the money + interest)
- Lender trait: allow liquidity providers to provide liquidity in exchange for vault shares which will allow providers to cash-out in exchange of their portion fees (proportional to their vault shares).

TODO: set logic for fees vault, fees sould go to another contract (a vault).
