# Prototype specification

### Key concepts
- the actions should be executed by an apposite user-contract rather than split in actions to be executed

### Workflow

-> = invocation
=> = transfer

A -> Lender    :  A calls the lender with the amount to borrow, the contract R to invoke (and the parameters)
Lender => R    :  Lender transfers the amount to the receiver
