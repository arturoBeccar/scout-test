# xycLoans Protocol
### Flash loans and liquidity protocol on Soroban with 0 fees

XycLoans is a flash loans protocol implemented for the Soroban Virtual Machine. 
The protocol manages its liquidity through its vaults, where lenders provide liquidity in exchange of yield generated from flash loan fees.

With xycLoans, contracts will be able to flash loan any available amount of liquidity as long as they repay it within the same transaction. 


# Why choose xycLoans

## Security

XycLoans is designed with the sole purpose of being a flash loans protocol. That is because it is built with lenders funds' security in mind, and wants to offer lenders the possibility to put liquidity in a simple and audited (we're working on this) protocol. 

The fact that xycLoans doesn't depend on price oracles, doesn't have complex rewards schemas, doesn't implement a governance system (while still keeping the product decentralized), and is developed by trusted members among the Soroban community makes it a good option for more cautious investors that seek to provide liquidity in DeFi systems that are less prone to security risk.

## 0 fees
xycLoans has no community token treasurery and no protocol fees (which in some DeFi projects go to developers and initial investors), which means that when you use xycLoans both as a borrower you are only paying the fees to lenders, and that lenders are receiving every single cent of the fees borrowers pay. This effictively makes for a protocol that has 0 fees.

# How the xyclooLabs team maintains xycLoans

If xyclooLabs does not take any fees from xycLoans, how do we maintain the product?

We have two main sources to keep the protocol running:
- Pro subscription to analytics and additional features in the UI.
- Sponsored protocol updates. The factory contract is controlled by us in that when a new version of xycLoans pools is developed, that will be the new reference pool for our users. However, there is no way us updating the factory contract's hashes has impact on the pools' state, thus on the lenders' liquidity. We will just offer the possibility to migrate to new versions of the contract. All the work we do for protocol updates and migration interfaces is sponsored by donations.
