<hr/>

Xycloans is a flash loans protocol built on Soroban. The protocol also has its own liquidity management, allowing investors to provide liquidity directly to the protocol and earn yield.

We recommend reading the [Litepaper](https://github.com/xycloo/xycloans/blob/main/xycloans.pdf) to learn more about the protocol, how it is currently designed and how developers and the wider DeFi ecosystem benefits from flash loans.
