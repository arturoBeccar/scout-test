# xycLoans Protocol
### Flash loans and liquidity protocol on Soroban

XycLoans is a flash loans protocol implemented for the Soroban Virtual Machine. 
The protocol manages its liquidity through its vaults, where lenders provide liquidity in exchange of yield generated from flash loan fees.

With xycLoans, contracts will be able to flash loan any available amount of liquidity as long as they repay it within the same transaction. 

The protocol is structured in pools made of `vault + flash_loan` pair where the primary focus is to keep pools a closed circuit and completely liquidity provider controlled without inferring any rules on the deposited liquidity.
