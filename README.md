# xycLoans Protocol
### Flash loans and liquidity protocol on Soroban

XycLoans is a flash loans protocol implemented for the Soroban Virtual Machine. 
The protocol manages its liquidity through its vaults, where lenders provide liquidity in exchange of yield generated from flash loan fees.

With xycLoans, contracts will be able to flash loan any available amount of liquidity as long as they repay it within the same transaction. 

XycLoans is designed with the sole purpose of being a flash loans protocol. That is because it is built with lenders funds' security in mind, and wants to offer lenders the possibility to put liquidity in a simple and audited (we're working on this) protocol. 
The fact that xycLoans doesn't depend on price oracles, doesn't have complex rewards schemas, doesn't implement a governance system (while still keeping the product decentralized), and is developed by trusted members among the Soroban community makes it a good option for more cautious investors that seek to provide liquidity in DeFi systems that are less prone to security risk
